## From Priorities to Posteriorities

Prioritization is a fundamental leadership skill that every good leader masters. It's relatively straightforward—we analyze tasks, assess their impact, and rank them by importance. Most leaders excel at identifying what matters most and organizing their teams around these priorities. The process feels natural: gather information, evaluate options, and create ordered lists. It's effective, actionable, and gives us a clear sense of direction.

But here's the challenge that many of us face: we often end up with too many "priorities," stretching our limited bandwidth thin. When everything becomes important, nothing truly is. This is where I've personally struggled throughout my career.

## My Personal Leadership Challenge

Prioritization has always been my Achilles' heel. I naturally gravitate toward helping everyone and tend to prioritize tasks I enjoy—especially those involving interesting challenges or opportunities to support others. There's something deeply satisfying about solving complex problems and making people's lives easier. However, while this feels rewarding in the moment, it often derails me from achieving higher-impact objectives that drive real organizational value.

I've learned that the desire to help everyone, while admirable, can become a leadership liability. When we say yes to everything that seems worthwhile, we dilute our effectiveness and risk disappointing the people counting on us for critical deliverables.

## The Power of Posteriorities

The difference between good and great leaders lies in mastering **posteriorities**—the deliberate art of deciding what *not* to do. While prioritizing is about choosing what's important, posteriorizing requires the courage to actively set things aside, even when they seem valuable or when people you care about advocate for them.

This concept transformed my approach to leadership. Posteriorities aren't just about saying no; they're about strategic sacrifice. They require us to acknowledge that every yes to one thing is an implicit no to something else.

## The Art of Empathetic Decision-Making

Defining posteriorities is inherently difficult because someone, somewhere, will always consider your posteriority their top priority. As a leader, your responsibility is to empathize with these perspectives, understand what motivates different stakeholders, and communicate your reasoning clearly.

Sometimes you can offer creative workarounds or alternative solutions. Other times, you must firmly explain your decision and invite those who disagree to make a compelling case for reprioritization. The key is being empathetic yet decisive. If your reasoning is sound and based on valid strategic considerations, you shouldn't fear moving items to the posteriority list.

When you do shift existing priorities, you must immediately revisit your goals, adjust timelines, and reset expectations with all stakeholders. Otherwise, you risk overcommitting and creating false expectations, which inevitably leads to frustration—both for yourselves and those who depend on you.

## The Balance Between Impact and Delivery

Learning to say "no" and embrace posteriorities has helped me find a healthier balance between what I enjoy and what truly drives impact. Great leaders don't just choose what to do—they courageously choose what not to do. This distinction separates those who manage tasks from those who create transformational change.

The most successful leaders I've observed aren't just skilled prioritizers; they're master posteriorizers who understand that leadership effectiveness isn't measured by how much you do, but by the impact of what you choose to focus on.
